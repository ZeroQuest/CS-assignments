Problem 1:
	3) The problem is that the program is not freeing all allocated memory.
	4) The problem occurs because the destructor deletes what the 
		nxt pointer is pointing to and does not traverse the entire list.
		So, the first link is deleted and the other links remain in memory.

Problem 2:
	4) Address Sanitizer states that there is a use-after-free error.
	5) The problem is that the copy constructor creates a shallow copy of the array.

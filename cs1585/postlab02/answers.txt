Q1) print_vector
Q2) The problem is the while condition is always true, 
	so it steps out of the vector into memory indefinitely 
	until it segfaults.
Q3) The variable i in the for loop does not increment, so it indefinitely loops.

Q4) The comparison operator is set to run the loop while i is 
	less than or equal to sum_this.size() which allows it 
	to step out of the array into memory. 
	Causing it to add a garbage value.

Problem 1
1) The asterisk matches any and all names by default.
2) It outputs every file in the directory, even hidden hidden files, because
	".*" matches every file extension.
3) You should never run rm -rf .* or rm -rf / because it will remove all
	files in the current directory (.*) or the root directory (/)
	including your operating system.


Problem 2
1) By using ls -lt -c
2) By using cat -n
3) The whatis command shows a short one line sentence from the manual
	 describing what the command you're querying is.


Problem 3
1) It contains the word apple.
2) It contains the word banana. > writes to a file on the first line
	and will overwrite information.
3) It contains the word banana and the word carrot on a line beneath it.
	>> writes to a file on the next empty line, unlike > which writes
	to the first line only.
4) The output is 1, 7, 14. | takes the output from a command or program
	and "pipes" or sends it to the input of another program or command.
